## R objects

R has variables that are used to access objects:

- functions
- data

### Functions

A function provides an action over objects or R itself. 

#### R related functions

```{r}
## this is the i_am function defined in the package here
## in general package::function
here::i_am("r-101-2024.Rproj")
## library loads the functions defined in a package (here)
library(here)
```

#### Functions that operate on objects

```{r}
class(1.0)
class(class)
```

If `f` is a function, `f(...)` applies the function to its parameters while 
`f` is the function as an object.
